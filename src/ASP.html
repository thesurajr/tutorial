    <h1>What is ASP?</h1>
    <p>ASP is also known as Active Server Pages or classic ASP. It is a Microsoft production developed as Microsoft's foremost server-side scripting engine that helps the developer construct dynamic web server applications. It combines COM components (Component Object Modules), scripting commands, and hypertext pages.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of ASP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ASP follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which helps distinct input, output, and processing of a certain application, providing advantages in software development.</li>
        <li>It is a framework technology that is a big help while developing large applications and also includes code reviews to improve coding quality and coding time.</li>
        <li>Some extended features include just-in-time compilation, early binding features, and native optimization.</li>
        <li>ASP provides drag-and-drop server controlling and WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing, making development more accessible.</li>
        <li>It is a language-independent software, allowing developers to use distinct programming languages.</li>
        <li>ASP allows for the distribution and replacement of ASP sub-components.</li>
        <li>One of the major eye-catching features of ASP includes secure web development by using Windows authentication and per-application configuration.</li>
        <li>Easy cross-platform development is possible with ASP.</li>
        <li>It enables continuous monitoring that keeps a constant watch on unethical events, such as handling infinite loops.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disadvantages of ASP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ASP can be relatively expensive compared to other alternatives, as it requires multiple licensing, including SQL server licenses, Visual Studio licenses, Windows Server licenses, and more.</li>
        <li>Documentation for ASP is not as comprehensive as that of some other frameworks.</li>
        <li>Updating previously created software can be challenging, as some code from earlier versions may not work on the next version.</li>
        <li>ASP cannot be installed in older versions of Windows and may require manual installation.</li>
    </ul>
